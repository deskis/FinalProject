# FinalProject
My solo project while attending Coder Camps

This is a full CRUD web application that allows the user to login, add, update or delete bands and their bio information.

It was created using ASP.NET technologies, mainly written in C#. The database is Microsoft SQL.

For the front end I used HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.
